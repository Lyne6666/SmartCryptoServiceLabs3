# SmartCryptoServiceLabs3

## Description

Initial project setup

## Features

- Integrate hardware security modules (HSMs) for secure key management and cryptographic operations.
- Implement a multi-signature scheme using Schnorr signatures to enhance transaction security and privacy.
- Develop a decentralized identity (DID) system based on verifiable credentials for user authentication.
- Utilize zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to enable privacy-preserving data sharing and computation.
- Incorporate a formal verification toolchain to rigorously analyze smart contract code and ensure correctness.
- Implement a robust rate limiting mechanism using token bucket algorithm to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
- Provide a RESTful API endpoint for programmatic access to historical transaction data and blockchain analytics.
- Develop an automated smart contract deployment pipeline using Infrastructure-as-Code principles with Terraform.
