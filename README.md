# SmartCryptoServiceLabs3

## Description

A curated collection of zero-knowledge proof circuits implemented in Circom and written in Rust, optimized for SNARK-friendly elliptic curves and providing verifiable computation of financial data.

## Features

- Integrates with hardware security modules (HSMs) to protect cryptographic keys.
- Deploys a distributed ledger technology (DLT) based on the Raft consensus algorithm for data integrity.
- Utilizes zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to enable privacy-preserving transactions.
- Implements a role-based access control (RBAC) system for secure data management and user permissions.
- Supports the creation and management of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) adhering to the ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards.
- Performs automated vulnerability scanning and penetration testing on smart contracts before deployment.
- Generates cryptographic key pairs using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) seeded with hardware entropy.
- Audits all smart contract interactions and logs events using a tamper-proof blockchain-based audit trail.
